heard of Earthquakes and some of us have experienced them.</p>\r\n                <p>An earthquake is a release of energy that literally shakes the ground beneath our feet.</p>\r\n                <h1>What causes Earthquakes?</h1>\r\n                <p>In order to understand Earthquakes we must first learn about plate tectonics.</p>\r\n                <h1>So what are these plate tectonics?</h1>\r\n                <p>The Earth isn't one solid sphere of mass, our planet has a lot of liquid like materials beneath the crust as in the surface layer.</p>\r\n                <p>The liquid like materials underneath the crust are much heavier than dirt, sand and everything else that is on the surface. That is why everything that is less heavy remains on top.</p>\r\n                <p>But the core of the earth is super hot. That super hot liquid then travels upward to the surface. Once it cools it becomes a solid surface.</p>\r\n                <p>Those are areas where new crust is formed. We call those areas mid-ocean ridges. This is called a divergent plate boundary.</p>\r\n                <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"500px\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pHWceRySDb8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\r\n                <p>The compass that you can see in the video is how scientists can determine when that hot liquid rose to the surface.</p>\r\n                <p>We know that North is up where santa is and South is where the penguins live. But every so often meaning several millions of years the polarity of the earth switches.</p>\r\n                <p>So the compass's needle would rotate 180 degrees.</p>\r\n                <p>Scientists can attach a large magnet to their ship and travel across a mid-ocean ridge, and they can determine the age of the surface from the shift in magnets polarity.</p>\r\n                <h1>The key idea!</h1>\r\n                <p>The key idea here is that when new land comes out of the ocean the old land needs to come down.</p>\r\n                <p>Old land has accumulated a lot of debris through it's time. And due to it's age it will have cooled down.</p>\r\n                <p>When objects of the same buoyancy (the ability to float on water) collide the colder, heavier plate will submerge. That is called a subduction plate boundary.</p>\r\n                <p>The tectonic plates at the bottom of the ocean are different than the plate that you and I are standing on.</p>\r\n                <p>They are called continental crusts.</p>\r\n                <p>When an oceanic crust collides with a continental crust the oceanic crust goes bellow the continental crust. This process also produces volcanoes. </p>\r\n                <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"500px\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F9uGSuyMclc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\r\n                <a href=\"/0505fe41dc0d6326052d78789f4b170a.html#volcanoes\">üåã We learn about Volcanoes here.</a>\r\n                <br><br> <br>\r\n                <p>When two continental plates collide neither one goes down but rather they both float upwards.

When they collide the the plate that remains on top slips, cracks and breaks.</p>\r\n                <p>That results in a sudden release of a LOT of energy, which then travels through the Earth until the energy is dissipated.</p>\r\n                <h1>So what causes an Earthquake?</h1>\r\n                <p>In simple terms the surface of the Earth suddenly shifts or breaks releasing a lot of energy that shakes ground.</p>\r\n                <h1>Where are earthquakes most common?</h1>\r\n                <img src=\"/107c7289141d649d6f5dd2b6ff4b94af.jpg\" alt=\"a map of the earth outlining the tectonic boundaries.\">\r\n                <a href=\"https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/plate-boundaries/\">‚èπÔ∏è National Geographic Article</a>\r\n                <br><br><br>\r\n                <p>The above image from National Geographic shows the plate boundaries of our planet.</p>\r\n                <p>Any place with that is close to the plate boundaries are prone to having lots of earthquakes.</p>\r\n                <h1>How dangerous is that natural hazard?</h1>\r\n                <p>Earthquakes can be harmless or EXTREMELY dangerous.</p>\r\n                <p>Earth Scientists use the Richter Scale to determine the intensity of the Earthquake.</p>\r\n                <p>A Richter Scale devised by Charles F. Richter, uses a seismograph to determine the intensity of the earthquakes on a scale of 1 to 10.</p>\r\n                <p>Magnitude 1 not being felt by humans to 10 being felt all around the world.</p>\r\n                <p>A seismograph is a tool that tracks how much the ground shakes.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"/04dcd24a37298eb703f622993f74a787.png\" alt=\"a description of the richter scale.\">\r\n                <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/Richter-scale\">Britannica on the Richter Scale.</a>\r\n                <br><br><br>\r\n                <p>Here is a video of a seismograph in action.</p>\r\n                <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"500px\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zUnjHjxFwKA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\r\n                <p>So to answer the question, it varies quite a lot. We can't predict earthquakes. And their intensity ranges in every area where they occur.</p>\r\n                <img src=\"/3edabc8160f47aa2133e1c09d9b3c82e.jpg\" alt=\"image of rubble in turkey after the earthquake.\">\r\n                <p>Unfortunately we do not possess the technology to predict earthquakes. Sudden tragedies like the one in Turkey 2023 will happen without us knowing until it's too late. However, as mentioned before if you live far from tectonic plate boundaries you are safe from such catastrophes.</p>\r\n                <p>If you do reside in such places have a plan ready. Know areas in your house where you can safely wait out an earthquake. Places near your fridge or tall cabinets. However if you can get out of the building please do so quickly!</p>\r\n                <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/defying-odds-story-survival-under-turkeys-earthquake-rubble-2023-02-15/#:~:text=Berber%2C%20a%2062%2Dyear%2D,out%2C%20drank%20his%20own%20urine.\">üçÄAn article of a man who survived 182 hours, from being trapped after an Earthquake.</a>\r\n                <br><br>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"content\">\r\n        <div id=\"landslide\">\r\n            <div class=\"content-paragraph\">\r\n                <img src=\"/c11c102dfcf6de18fc1b7b7abcb6e936.jpg\" alt=\"a man traversing over a landslide over the road.\">\r\n                <h1>What is a Landslide?</h1>\r\n                <p>A landslide is exactly as it sounds, the loose solids on the slope of the mountain trickle down after some event that shakes the mountain.</p>\r\n                <p>That event could have been an earthquake, strong winds, lot's of rainfall, or even tsunamis.</p>\r\n                <p>But the question is how do they get so loose?
