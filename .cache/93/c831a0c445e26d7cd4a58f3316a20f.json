energy that displace the ocean waters.</p>\r\n                <p>Such outbursts of energy can be caused by</p>\r\n                <ol>\r\n                    <li>Earthquakes sudden shift of tectonic plates.</li>\r\n                    <li>Landslides sudden shift of land shifts the ocean waters.</li>\r\n                    <li>Volcanic activity AKA volcanic explosions under the ocean.</li>\r\n                    <li>Even meteorites can cause tsunamis, as they carry a lot of energy release at once into the ocean.</li>\r\n                </ol>\r\n                <p>Take a look at this video.</p>\r\n                <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"500px\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KB-TO5kq5Aw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\r\n                <p>Here we can see two tectonic plates colliding and the plate that staying on top slips releasing a LOT of energy.</p>\r\n                <p>This plate boundary is called a subduction, as one plate sub-ducts AKA goes under the other plate. The plate that remains on top tries to resist the push and over time builds up energy. That plate then slips releasing all of that stored\r\n                    up energy displacing the water above. The water then rushes outward in all directions. And If powerful enough it reaches the shoreline.</p>\r\n                <h1>How often do tsunamis happen?</h1>\r\n                <p>According to tsunami.gov \"tsunamis that cause damage or deaths near their source occur approximately twice per year.\"</p>\r\n                <h1>How to prepare for a tsunami?</h1>\r\n                <p>If you don't live anywhere near a shoreline you are mostly from Tsunamis.</p>\r\n                <p>If you reside near a shoreline no matter how far from the ring of fire you are located, you must look out for a few things.</p>\r\n                <ol>\r\n                    <li>If you feel an earthquake.</li>\r\n                    <li>If you hear a loud roar from the ocean (like a train or an airplane).</li>\r\n                    <li>Water moving back unusually far and revealing the ocean floor.</li>\r\n                </ol>\r\n                <p>Then run!

Leave your belongings, help others to get as high up as possible.</p>\r\n                <p>Other than looking out for these signs and listening to your local authorities there isn't much you can do.
