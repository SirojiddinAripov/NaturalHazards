          <h1>What are the causes?</h1>\r\n                <ol>\r\n                    <li>Negligent humans - who don't put out campfires completely. Or simply doing gender reveal party...</li>\r\n                    <li>Lightning - a natural event that strikes the closest object from it's source. Tree tops are commonly hit setting the tree on fire, and if the tree is surrounded by dry enough wood then the forest fire begins.</li>\r\n                    <li>Global Warming - is causing many areas to get more and more dry. The result of which is wast amounts of fuel for the fire to use. </li>\r\n                </ol>\r\n                <p>For a forest fire to occur, it needs 3 ingredients.</p>\r\n                <ol>\r\n                    <li>Source of fire - discussed above.</li>\r\n                    <li>Fuel - dry bushes, branches, fallen over old trees, and homes.</li>\r\n                    <li>Oxygen</li>\r\n                </ol>\r\n                <h1>How to stop a forest fire?</h1>\r\n                <p>We are assuming that you are a regular citizen and not a forest ranger. Hence YOU can only prevent forest fires from happening in the first place. But once it has started you need to get to safety as soon as possible and leave the rest to the professionals.</p>\r\n                <p>What you can do prevent fires.</p>\r\n                <ol>\r\n                    <li>If camping put out the campfires completely. Douse the flames in water and ensure that no other fuel sources are in the immediate area of the campfire.</li>\r\n                    <li>If your friend is planning a gender reveal party, remind them politely that the man who caused the forest fire in 2020 had to go to jail, and it costed $42,000,000 to put out the flames.</li>\r\n                    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Dorado_Fire#:~:text=The%20El%20Dorado%20Fire%20burned,reopened%20on%20September%2029%2C%202020.\">🌐El Dorado Forest Fire</a>\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    <li>If you spot even a tiny bit of flames IMMEDIATELY report to local authorities!

Hot-spots is an area below the crust with a lot of magma reserves. So as the tectonic plate above moves the magma reservoir pushes it's magma out.</p>\r\n                <p>Here is a video to better help understand the idea.</p>\r\n                <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"500px\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7bOTFk7P_1g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\r\n                \r\n                <h1>Three Stages of Volcanic Activity</h1>\r\n                <ol>\r\n                    <li>Active - shows activity like eruption of lava, release of gas, or seismic (AKA Earthquakes) activity.</li>\r\n                    <a href=\"/72beb9190a95e07c376a1b863d9fdd63.html#tsunami\">🌊Want to know what the seismic (AKA Earthquakes) activity cause?</a>\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    <li>Dormant - has not erupted in a long time, but has enough material to erupt again.</li>\r\n                    <li>Extinct - will never erupt again.</li>\r\n                </ol>\r\n                <h1>Can we predict volcanic eruption?</h1>\r\n                <p>Yes!

That gas is inside of magma with more magma above it.</p>\r\n                <p>So all of the gas is under a LOT of pressure. As the amount of magma slowly rises, more and more magma gets removed from the top meaning there is less pressure on the gasses. That gas can now expand at a rapid rate and push more and more lava out. It's repeated cycle until either the volcano runs out of gasses or magma. If it runs of gas first and still has some magma left, then over time it can erupt again. But if it's completely out of juice then it's done forever.</p>\r\n                <h1>What about Yellowstone? Will it end humanity?</h1>\r\n                <p>The short answer no.
