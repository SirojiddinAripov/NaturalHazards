The plate that remains on top tries to resist the push and over time builds up energy. That plate then slips releasing all of that stored up energy displacing the water above. The water then rushes outward in all directions. And If powerful enough it reaches the shoreline.</p> <h1>How often do tsunamis happen?</h1> <p>According to tsunami.gov "tsunamis that cause damage or deaths near their source occur approximately twice per year."</p> <h1>How to prepare for a tsunami?</h1> <p>If you don't live anywhere near a shoreline you are mostly from Tsunamis.</p> <p>If you reside near a shoreline no matter how far from the ring of fire you are located, you must look out for a few things.</p> <ol> <li>If you feel an earthquake.</li> <li>If you hear a loud roar from the ocean (like a train or an airplane).</li> <li>Water moving back unusually far and revealing the ocean floor.</li> </ol> <p>Then run! Get as high up as you can! Leave your belongings, help others to get as high up as possible.</p> <p>Other than looking out for these signs and listening to your local authorities there isn't much you can do. If there area you're in is known for tsunamis scout out a route to the nearest tallest building.</p> <p>Tsunamis occur at random times from earthquakes. And at the moment we do not posses technology that is capable of predicting an earthquake.</p> <p>Other causes of Tsunamis from volcanoes, meteorites or landslides can not be predicted either.</p> <a href="https://www.tsunami.gov/">üåä A live map for Tsunamis and more information on tsunamis.</a> <br><br> </div> </div> </div> <div class="content"> <div id="floods"> <img src="/children-floods.35b885f5.jpg" alt="an image of children going to school through knee deep water"> <div class="content-paragraph"> <h1>What is a Flood?</h1> <p>Flood is a sudden income of large amounts of water that covers land that normally dry in water.</p> <h1>What causes Floods?</h1> <ol> <li>Tsunamis - due to sheer force and amount of water that moves inland.</li> <li>Heavy rain - less devastating, but still can displace a large number of people and leave many without a place to call home.</li> <li>Human activity - due to ocean levels rising from Global Warming, most areas are more prone to flooding due to more water being in the ocean.</li> </ol> <h1>Where are floods the most common?</h1> <p>Since it can rain almost anywhere in the world, floods can also occur anywhere.</p> <p>But some areas are much more likely to get flooded.

It takes just 12 inches of rushing water to carry away most cars and just 2 feet of rushing water can carry away SUVs and trucks.
