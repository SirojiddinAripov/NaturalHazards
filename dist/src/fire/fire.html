                <h1>What is a Forest Fire?</h1>
                <p>A Forest Fire is a massive chain reaction of fire that starts out small and escalates very quickly.</p>
                <h1>What are the causes?</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Negligent humans - who don't put out campfires completely. Or simply doing gender reveal party...</li>
                    <li>Lightning - a natural event that strikes the closest object from it's source. Tree tops are commonly hit setting the tree on fire, and if the tree is surrounded by dry enough wood then the forest fire begins.</li>
                    <li>Global Warming - is causing many areas to get more and more dry. The result of which is wast amounts of fuel for the fire to use. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>For a forest fire to occur, it needs 3 ingredients.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Source of fire - discussed above.</li>
                    <li>Fuel - dry bushes, branches, fallen over old trees, and homes.</li>
                    <li>Oxygen</li>
                </ol>
                <h1>How to stop a forest fire?</h1>
                <p>We are assuming that you are a regular citizen and not a forest ranger. Hence YOU can only prevent forest fires from happening in the first place. But once it has started you need to get to safety as soon as possible and leave the rest to the professionals.</p>
                <p>What you can do prevent fires.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If camping put out the campfires completely. Douse the flames in water and ensure that no other fuel sources are in the immediate area of the campfire.</li>
                    <li>If your friend is planning a gender reveal party, remind them politely that the man who caused the forest fire in 2020 had to go to jail, and it costed $42,000,000 to put out the flames.</li>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Dorado_Fire#:~:text=The%20El%20Dorado%20Fire%20burned,reopened%20on%20September%2029%2C%202020.">🌐El Dorado Forest Fire</a>
                    <br><br>
                    <li>If you spot even a tiny bit of flames IMMEDIATELY report to local authorities! Though the smoke should be enough to signal them that there is a forest fire for the rangers, you never know if they are sleeping or not being vigilant so make sure to notify the authorities.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>How the forest fire is put once it's out of control?</p>
                <p>For the fire to stop we need to remove one of it's ingredients.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Water or Dirt to stop oxygen supply</li>
                    <br>
                    <img src="/helicopter_seaplane_forest_fire.14945d98.jpg" alt="">
                    <li>Remove the fuel from the forest fires path.</li>
                    <br>
                    <img src="/Controlled.a35faddd.jpg" alt="">
                </ol>
                <p>Wait is he really starting another forest fire? What?</p>
                <p>Yes! That is called controlled burning. What the firefighters are hoping to achieve from this is that the fire that they started will burn all of the fuel before the main forest fire can reach that fuel and continue burning.</p>
                <p>So here is Original forest fire</p>
                <p>🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲<-🔥->🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲</-🔥-></p>
                <p>🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲<-🔥🪵🔥->🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲</-🔥🪵🔥-></p>
                <p>🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲<-🔥🪵🪵🪵🔥->🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲</-🔥🪵🪵🪵🔥-></p>
                <p>It's spreading very quickly in all directions. Then fire firefighters come in and start their Controlled Burning.</p>
                <p>🌲🌲🌲🌲👨‍🚒🔥->🌲🌲<-🔥🪵🪵🪵🔥->🌲🌲<-🔥👩‍🚒🌲🌲🌲🌲></-🔥👩‍🚒🌲🌲🌲🌲></-🔥🪵🪵🪵🔥-></p>

                <p>Once the fires meet in the middle there isn't anymore fuel for them to burn. So they put each other out.</p>
                <p>🌲🌲🌲🌲👨‍🚒🪵🪵🪵🪵🪵🪵🪵🪵🪵🪵🪵🪵🪵🪵👩‍🚒🌲🌲🌲🌲</p>
                <p>Firefighters sacrifice a small portion of the forest to save the rest of forest and wild life in that area.</p>

                <h1>What is a Volcano?</h1>
                <p>Volcano is a result of plate tectonic subduction that then pushes the magma from below the earths crust onto the surface.</p>
                <p>The area most common in volcanoes is known as the ring of fire.</p>
                <img src="/Pacific_Ring_of_Fire.svg.6b524900.png" alt="">
                <a href="/src\earth\earth.html#earthquake">🌎We learned about how plate tectonics work here.</a>
                <br><br><br>
                <p>Each area around the ring of fire is a subduction zone, (continental crust -> < - oceanic crust) which results in volcanoes popping up.</p>
                <p>Another way volcanoes can form is from hot-spots. Hot-spots is an area below the crust with a lot of magma reserves. So as the tectonic plate above moves the magma reservoir pushes it's magma out.</p>
                <p>Here is a video to better help understand the idea.</p>

                <h1>Three Stages of Volcanic Activity</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Active - shows activity like eruption of lava, release of gas, or seismic (AKA Earthquakes) activity.</li>
                    <a href="/src\water\water.html#tsunami">🌊Want to know what the seismic (AKA Earthquakes) activity cause?</a>
                    <br><br>
                    <li>Dormant - has not erupted in a long time, but has enough material to erupt again.</li>
                    <li>Extinct - will never erupt again.</li>
                </ol>
                <h1>Can we predict volcanic eruption?</h1>
                <p>Yes! Which is great news as no-one wants to become a piece of smoked BBQ.</p>
                <p>Scientists have multiple ways of monitoring volcanic activity.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Scientists use seismic stations around the world to monitor the activity around the volcanoes.</li>
                    <li>Land movement can be monitored using GPS stations that track the slightest movements of the ground.</li>
                    <li>If the Volcano starts emitting gasses then scientists can conclude that something is up!</li>
                </ol>
                <h1>Why do volcanoes erupt?</h1>
                <p>Below each volcano there is something called a magma chamber, which is just a LOT of magma that is that was pushed up by the plate tectonics.</p>
                <p>Magma is super heavy and the debris that is inside of it gets broken down to gasses. That gas is inside of magma with more magma above it.</p>
                <p>So all of the gas is under a LOT of pressure. As the amount of magma slowly rises, more and more magma gets removed from the top meaning there is less pressure on the gasses. That gas can now expand at a rapid rate and push more and more lava out. It's repeated cycle until either the volcano runs out of gasses or magma. If it runs of gas first and still has some magma left, then over time it can erupt again. But if it's completely out of juice then it's done forever.</p>
                <h1>What about Yellowstone? Will it end humanity?</h1>
                <p>The short answer no. The long answer no. Many people refer to Yellowstone as a SUPER VOLCANO! Which is not a Scientific term. You see Scientists need money to continue their work. And they need to get funding somehow. So in order to attract attention to themselves they come up with panic inducing names to make it sound like life or death.</p>
                <p>Which Scientist would you fund if you had loads of money?</p>
                <p>Scientist 1: "I want to study the hot-spot that is below the Yellowstone national park to gain a deeper understanding of volcano formations from hot-spots."</p>
                <p>Scientist 2: "There is a MASSIVE SUPER VOLCANO IN YELLOWSTONE and if you won't let me conduct research on it, HUMANITY might GO EXTINCT!"</p>
                <p>The media headlines such as "Yellowstone Overdue for an eruption" are also made for people to click on their article and generate revenue from ads in their websites.</p>
